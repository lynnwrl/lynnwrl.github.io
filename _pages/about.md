I earned a Bachelor’s degree at [the China University of Geosciences (Beijing)](https://en.cugb.edu.cn/). During my undergraduate studies at CUGB, I had the opportunity to participate in several fieldworks, totaling about four months, which sparked my deep fascination with fossils and of course paleobiology and evolutionary topics. As a result, I actively engaged in various activities, including serving as a museum docent at several paleobiology museum for more than three years, joining the university’s paleobiological research summer program, and attending the summer camp for outstanding students in paleobiology organized by the Chinese Academy of Sciences during my senior year.

Starting my Master's in 2017 at [the Nanjing Institute of Geology and Palaeontology, CAS](http://english.nigpas.cas.cn/), I joined [Prof. Maoyan Zhu](http://english.nigpas.cas.cn/sourcedb/yjy/200907/t20090728_644237.html)'s lab, co-supervised also by [Prof. Fangchen Zhao](http://english.nigpas.cas.cn/sourcedb/yjy/201207/t20120718_644241.html) and [Prof. Zongjun Yin](http://english.nigpas.cas.cn/sourcedb/yjy/201301/t20130111_644252.html). I developed a solid foundation in the study of exceptionally preserved fossils through extensive work with fossils from the Weng'an Biota and Chengjiang Lagerstätte. I gained hands-on experience in fossil excavation and collection, acid preparation in the lab, and rock sectioning techniques. Additionally, I received thorough training in microscopy and micro-spectroscopy, becoming proficient with a wide range of optical and chemical analysis instruments. Alongside my training in geology and paleontology, I also took courses in cell biology, developmental biology, phycology, botany, and genetics to better understand the relationship between ancient and modern organisms.

For better understanding the relationship between fossil and modern species, I am now working with [Prof. Philip C J Donoghue FRS](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Philip-Donoghue-4fd2d6ef-3986-4566-97e4-7ae7db296525/) and [Prof. Davide Pisani](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/people/person/Davide-Pisani-27ef6f2a-19b3-4474-b71c-e61f2c8585a4/) at the Paleo Group of [the University of Bristol](https://www.bristol.ac.uk/earthsciences/research/palaeobiology/). My PhD project is about **constraining topological and temporal uncertainty in evolutionary history**, applying multiple Bayesian-based methods to better co-ordinate the discrepancy in terms of fossils and molecular data in evolutionary scenarios for the key clades such as angiosperms, metazoans, and eukaryotes.

Everything is ongoing, and there will definitely be more soon. I am glad to share and let you know more about me and my research in the upcoming future!
